let myVariable;
//semi colons at the end of sentences indicated where
//the sentence ends
myVariable = "Bob";
// or you can do
let myVariable = "Bob";
//Retrieve it by calling variable name
myVariable;
// u can change this value later in the code
myVariable = 'Steve';
//js also has strings, booleans but also has
//numbers python equivalent of integer
//array ie let myVariable = [1, 'bob' 2, 'Steve']
//arrays let you store multiple values in a single ref
let myVariable = 3;
myVariable === 4;
//This performs a test to see if two values are equal 
// and of the same data type
